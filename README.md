# Coffee Grinder

This is a simple project I setup while learning [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/).
I used this project to educate myself and also showcase some of the features of CoffeeScript to others.

This project presents three views of whats going on. The first is where CoffeeScript is written and edited.
The second is used to output and present the compiled to JavaScript version. And the third is used to present runtime output.
